Wheatfield with Crows - Van Gogh

In his final days, Van Gogh painted several depictions of the wheatfields surrounding him. Out of them, this one is the most famous, but also the darkest. It seems to show a sense of isolation and loneliness, with a path ending in the middle of the field, going nowhere, circled by crows. It’s a gloomy image.

There are plenty of other interpretations of the painting – including a line of thought that there is not a note of angst or despair to be found (Walther and Metzger) – and ultimately there’s no way of knowing the artist’s motivations. What we do know for sure is that the dramatic colour palette, a kind of mix between The Starry Night and Sunflowers, makes this one of Van Gogh’s most visceral and striking paintings.
