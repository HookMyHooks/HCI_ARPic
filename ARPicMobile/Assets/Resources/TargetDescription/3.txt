Sunflowers - Van Gogh

Van Gogh himself seems to have been absolutely delighted by sunflowers, reflected both in the sheer amount of sunflower-based paintings he created as well as his descriptions in the letters he wrote to his brother and friends.

In 1888, Van Gogh wrote: “I’m painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won’t surprise you when it’s a question of painting large sunflowers.” Basically, he loved painting sunflowers, and everyone knew it. In the same letter, he would explain how it was his dream to work in a studio alongside his friend Paul Gauguin, and that he planned to create decorations for the walls consisting of huge sunflower paintings.

It can be guessed that Gauguin himself was likely a fan of sunflowers too – particularly the ones that Van Gogh painted. In 1889, Gauguin ‘claimed’ one of the sunflower paintings in exchange for some of his own work which he left to Van Gogh, to Vincent’s great dismay:

“I am definitely keeping my sunflowers in question. He has two of them already, let that hold him. And if he is not satisfied with the exchange he has made with me, he can take back his little Martinique canvas, and his self-portrait he sent to me from Brittany, at the same time giving me back both my portrait and the two sunflower canvases which he has taken to Paris. So if he ever broaches this subject again, I’ve told you just how matters stand.”
