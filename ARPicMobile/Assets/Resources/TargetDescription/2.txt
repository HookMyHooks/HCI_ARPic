Starry Night Over the Rhône - Van Gogh

Van Gogh seems to have been particularly enchanted by the night sky, and the gas lighting visible across the water in Arles. He was excited enough about the painting to include a sketch of it to his friend, the painter Eugène Boch, and the work was publicly exhibited in 1889 at the Société des Artistes Indépendants in Paris.

He also described the painting in almost loving detail in one of the many letters he wrote to his brother Theo, describing it as “…the starry sky painted by night, actually under a gas jet. The sky is aquamarine, the water is royal blue, the ground is mauve. The town is blue and purple. The gas is yellow and the reflections are russet gold descending down to green-bronze. On the aquamarine field of the sky the Great Bear is a sparkling green and pink, whose discreet paleness contrasts with the brutal gold of the gas. Two colorful figurines of lovers in the foreground.”
