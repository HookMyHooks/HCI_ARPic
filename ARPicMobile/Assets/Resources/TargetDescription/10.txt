Bedroom in Arles - Van Gogh

This was Van Gogh’s bedroom in ‘The Yellow House’, which he shared with Gauguin. The closed door on the left led to the spare bedroom, in which Gauguin slept. In a letter to his friend, Vincent stated that the original painting in this series came about due to an extended bout of illness during which he was bedridden for several days.

One small and nice fact that keen-eyed observers might note is the miniature portraits hanging next to the bed. This is the 19th-century equivalent of putting polaroids of your friends on the wall – the people pictured are Van Gogh’s contemporaries and good friends Eugène Boch and Paul-Eugène Milliet.
