The Potato Eaters - Van Gogh

Van Gogh loved this painting. Two years after finishing it, he wrote a letter to his sister claiming that ‘’… the painting of the peasants eating potatoes that I did in Nuenen is after all the best thing I did“. It’s likely that the subject matter and the execution of the painting was quite close to Van Gogh’s heart, and that he was genuinely excited at having finished what he considered to be one of his masterpieces.

He also seemed genuinely hurt by the criticism he received on the painting from his friend, fellow Dutch painter Anthon van Rappard, and sternly rebuked him stating that he ‘’… had no right to condemn my work in the way you did.”

Aside from its special place in the artist’s own heart, the painting is notable for slightly darker reasons: it’s been stolen not once, but twice – first from the Kröller-Müller Museum in 1988, then from the Van Gogh Museum in 1991. In both cases, especially the latter (the escape car blew a tire and the thieves were forced to leave the paintings behind), the work was returned safely and unharmed.
