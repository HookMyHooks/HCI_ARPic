Irises - Van Gogh

After checking himself into an asylum due to his deteriorating mental health, Van Gogh almost immediately began to work on this painting. He referred to the act of painting as “the lightning conductor for my illness”, and threw himself into his work by creating depictions of the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum’s flower garden.

It’s not hard to imagine that spending all day in the garden gave Vincent some sort of serenity or peace, however temporary it may have been. While the artist himself considered it to be simply a ‘study’ (not good enough to be a work of art in its own right), his brother Theo realised that Vincent had created something special and submitted it to the Société des Artistes Indépendants, where it was exhibited alongside Starry Night Over the Rhône.
