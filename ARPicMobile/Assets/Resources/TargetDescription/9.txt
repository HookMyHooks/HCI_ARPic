Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear - Van Gogh

While living with his friend (this is up for debate) and fellow artist Paul Gauguin in Paris, Van Gogh proved to be a less-than-perfect roommate. He and Gauguin had frequent disagreements, which occasionally turned violent. During one such disagreement, Van Gogh is believed to have experienced a seizure, and threatened Gauguin with a razor before injuring himself instead, cutting off a part of his left ear and severing an artery in his own neck. In a heightened mental state, Vincent visited a local brothel and presented the lobe of his ear to one of the sex workers. He was taken to hospital the next day, with no recollection of the events that took place.
