Self Portrait - Van Gogh

Van Gogh often painted pictures of himself. There are various reasons that might come to mind (pure artistic vanity, or wanting to document his physical and mental changes), but there’s another one that isn’t often brought up: he simply didn’t have the money to pay for models to sit down for hours at a time. While Van Gogh didn’t live in abject poverty – a myth that is often repeated – managing money was a struggle.

His correspondence with his brother reveals a reliance on his monthly allowance from Theo, which never seemed to be quite enough to match Vincent’s ambitions. Art supplies were expensive back then, as they are now, and hiring a model may have been one step too far for someone who was inspired primarily by nature.

More than anything, the story behind this painting follows Van Gogh’s own journey, particularly as it relates to his mental health. While in a letter to his brother (discussing this self-portrait) he insists that he’s in a better place now, in retrospect it’s painfully obvious to see that all was not well.

“I hope you will notice that my facial expressions have become much calmer, although my eyes have the same insecure look as before, or so it appears to me.”
